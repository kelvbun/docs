### Syntax for durations
Sometimes a command requires a `time`, for example the command for starting giveaways.
The following units can be used for a duration:
- `s` seconds
- `m` minutes
- `h` hours
- `d` days
- `w` weeks
- `y` years

Not only that, you can also combine the units, for example `7d12h` would equal a duration of 7 days and 12 hours.
