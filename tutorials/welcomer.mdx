### What Welcomer does
Welcomer sends a message in a channel when a new member joins your server.  
You can control:
- Which channel receives the message
- What content is sent
- When the message is sent
- How long the message stays before being deleted
- Whether the welcomer is enabled
- What webhook name is used


## Step 1: Add a welcome channel
The main setup command is **/welcomer add**.  
This command supports **multiple parameters**, allowing you to configure everything at once.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer add [channel] [content_name] [delay] [delete_after] [enable] [webhook_name]
```

</CodeGroup>

### Parameters explained
- `channel` (optional) <br/>
  The channel that will receive welcome messages
  If omitted, the current channel is used

- `content_name` (optional) <br/>
  The custom content used for the welcome message
  You can change this later using **/welcomer set**

- `delay` (optional) <br/>
  How long to wait before sending the welcome message
  Examples: **5s**, **1m**, **10m**

- `delete_after` (optional) <br/>
  How long before the welcome message is automatically deleted
  Examples: **30s**, **5m**, **1h**
  Set to **0s** to disable auto-deletion

- `enable` (optional, default: true) <br/>
  Whether the welcomer should be enabled immediately

- `webhook_name` (optional) <br/>
  The name of the webhook used to send welcome messages
  Defaults to **baobun**


## Step 2: Update content (optional)
If you didn't assign content during setup, or want to change it later:

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer content <content_name> [channel]
```
</CodeGroup>

- This updates the content without re-adding the channel


## Step 3: Adjust timing (optional)
You can change the delay at any time.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer delay <delay> [channel]
```
</CodeGroup>

- Useful if you want to fine-tune when the message appears


## Step 4: Control message deletion (optional)
Change or disable auto-deletion for welcome messages.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer delete-after <time> [channel]
```
</CodeGroup>

- Keeps welcome channels clean
- Set to **0s** to keep messages permanently


## Step 5: Enable or disable Welcomer
Enable the welcomer on or off for a channel.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer enable [channel]
```
</CodeGroup>

- Useful for temporarily disabling welcomes without removing configuration


## Step 6: Test your setup
Always test before going live.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer test
```
</CodeGroup>

- Sends a test welcome message using the current configuration


## Example full setup (one command)
Here's an example of configuring everything at once:

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/welcomer add #welcome default-welcome 5s 1m true "Welcomer"
```
</CodeGroup>

This setup:
- Sends messages in **#welcome**
- Uses **default-welcome** content
- Delays messages by 5 seconds
- Enables Welcomer immediately
- Uses a custom webhook name of "Welcomer"
- Deletes messages after 1 minute


## Tips and best practices
- Test after every change
- Set **delete_after** for busy servers
- Use webhooks to make messages look cleaner with your own branding

## Troubleshooting
If welcome messages are not sending:

- Make sure the bot has permission to manage webhooks
- Confirm the channel is enabled
- Verify content exists
- Check delay and delete timers
- Run **/welcomer test**
