### What DM on Join does
DM on Join sends a **direct message** to users when they join your server.  
You can control:
- Whether DM on Join is enabled
- What message content is sent
- Test messages before going live

DM on Join does **not** use channels, delays, webhooks, or auto-deletion.  
Messages are sent directly to the user's DMs.


## Step 1: Enable DM on Join
The main setup command is `/dm enable`.  
This command enables or disables DM on Join for the server.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/dm enable
```

</CodeGroup>

- Running this command enables DM on Join
- Running it again disables DM on Join
- The state is saved per server


## Step 2: Assign DM content
DM on Join uses **custom content** for the message sent to new members.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/dm content <content_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

- `content_name` is the name of the custom content to use
- The content should be written as a DM-friendly message
- You can update this at any time without disabling DM on Join

Tip: Use `/content view` to preview the message before assigning it. <br/>
Learn more about creating custom content in the [Custom Contents Guide](/tutorials/customcontent).


## Step 3: Test your setup
Before waiting for a real user to join, send a test DM.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/dm test
```
</CodeGroup>

- Sends a test DM to you using the current configuration
- Confirms that content and permissions are working


## Example setup
A typical setup might look like this:

- DM on Join: enabled
- Content: `welcome-dm`

Commands used:
- `/dm enable`
- `/dm content welcome-dm`
- `/dm test`


## Tips and best practices
- Avoid sending too many links in DMs, users don't like spam
- Always test before enabling on large servers


## Troubleshooting
If DM on Join is not sending messages:
- Make sure DM on Join is enabled
- Verify content exists and is assigned
- Ensure users have DMs open from server members
- Run `/dm test` to confirm configuration
